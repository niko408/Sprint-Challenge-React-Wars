1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS solves having to create multiple similar components by allowing us to manipulate data in components with differing states.

1. Describe component state.

Component state is separated with two variables, the current instance/value and the variable/function that changes the current instance/value of that component.

1. Describe props.

Props are basically the parameters being passed through a component

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are functions that run after the component has finished rendering and can be set with certain conditions to be run when a condition is met such as running a function after one render or after a certain variable changes during another render.
